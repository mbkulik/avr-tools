** Bloom

- Will not compile since procps-ng has changed api for procps/readproc.h
- will re investigate in future
- needs php-mbstring php-xml packages


** avarice

- build, needs autoconf automake for building from HEAD
- will package and test

** avr-gdb

- based on gdb-minimal rpm build but with avr target
- needs testing
- Do we need to pull in fedora's gdb patches?
